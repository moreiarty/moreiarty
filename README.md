### Hi, friends
I code, build cloud based integration platforms and more generally anything else on the web. At the moment, I'm working on building an Azure-based fintech integration platform, where I'm (re)learning a lot of C#/.NET microservice-y things. I love JavaScript, cloud services, mechanical keyboards, and music. 

If you want to talk to me about any of those things, you can find me at these places: [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/pranavmore) | [Email](mailto:pm@pranavmore.dev) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hexboycodes).
