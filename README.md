# Hi, friends
I code a lot, build integration platforms and more generally anything else on the web. Currently working on some super cool serverless data integrations for state firefighting services! I love JavaScript, cloud services, mechanical keyboards, and Vampire Weekend/Brockhampton/Arctic Monkeys/literally any music.  Currently at Woolworths Group
